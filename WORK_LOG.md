| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Nov 1   |    3-4pm    |     I spent some time thinking about possible ways to solve this problem and then tried to do a little bit of code. I think the best way to solve this would probably be through a hash count like the previous problem set, so I copied the code from implementing a hash count over to this set. From this I'm going to try and find a way to somehow change it in a way so that it's universal. |
| Nov 2   |  2:30-3pm   | I tried to think of a way to determine what kind of data is being inserted into the method, because that would help determine exactly what the code would have to do. To do this, I would probably have to use some kind of if statement to check the name of the file and from there implementing the kind of way I need to create the hashcount. I'm going to try to implement that a bit later. |
| Nov 3   |   9-10am    |                                            I tried to implement some arraylists that took each indvidual csv and put the values into it. I also got some further explanation on exactly what to do for my table and how to add things to it so it makes a lot more sense now. I'm going to try and implement that later on but I think I understand exactly what I have to do a little better now. |
| Nov 3   |  4-4:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to think of a way to add the key value and actual value to a sort of table. Right now I just put in a double array and then created hash counts for the key and actual values which I will somehow add to the table. |
| Nov 6   | 1:15-1:45pm |                                                                                                                   I tried to start doing the problem set with the hint. So far I have created the instance variables and started to create the tables. Right now I'm a little bit confused on how exactly to resize in a way where I can keep me previous values so I don't have to do them again. |
| Nov 9   | 1:15-2:30pm |                                                  I was able to finish coding the problem set. I was able to solve the problem of the resizing by creating temporary variables that kept track of the old arrays and table size which I then put into a for loop to add. I made a slight mistake where I forgot to check if those values were null which caused some errors but then I fixed that.  |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
